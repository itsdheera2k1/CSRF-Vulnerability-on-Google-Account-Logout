CSRF Vulnerability on Google Account Logout

📜 Description
This repository contains a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability affecting the logout functionality on Google accounts.

🔗 Target URL:
https://accounts.google.com/logout

🎯 Vulnerability Type:
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)


🚨 Risk:
Medium

⚙️ Exploitability:
Low to Medium
This exploit relies on scenarios where a user can be tricked into clicking a crafted link or visiting a malicious website.

👥 Affected Users:
All authenticated users of Google accounts.

💥 Potential Consequences
Forced logout of Google accounts without user consent.
While it disrupts user activity, it does not directly compromise user data.


🛠️ Technical Details
This vulnerability allows an attacker to simulate a logout request using a simple HTML form, effectively bypassing the CSRF protection token.

🧪 [Proof of Concept (index.html)](./index.html)

The PoC included here demonstrates how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability. By hosting a crafted webpage (such as the index.html in this repo), users can unknowingly trigger the logout process.

How It Works:
The PoC triggers a logout request by submitting a form without the user's knowledge.
When the user is authenticated with their Google account and interacts with the malicious webpage, they are logged out involuntarily.
